# Black-Scholes Greeks

A Python project for computing and visualizing the Greeks of European call and put options using the Black-Scholes model.

This project calculates Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta and generates plots showing how each Greek varies with the underlying asset price. This repository contains also a small PDF **Greeks in Options** on Greeks theory written by me.
